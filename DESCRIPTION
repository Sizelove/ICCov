Description: This package conducts nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of regression models for various responses depending on an interval-censored covariate. Current functionality includes a continuous variable, an analog to linear regression. Dependencies between the response and the interval-censored covariate can be specified through pre-specified or user-supplied functions. For full details, model description, and estimation procedures see Sizelove, Zeng, and Lin (2023).
